# Execution Runs

Record routed runs only when execution controls were used: branching, retries, timeouts, checkpoints, output budgets, or partial-result handling.

Do not duplicate ordinary request logging here. Simple linear routes belong only in 03_logs/user_requests.md.

| Date | Request summary | Route | Controls used | Final status | Checkpoint/report | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Status Values
- `completed`
- `partial`
- `failed`
- `blocked`

## Control Values
- `dependency_graph`
- `retry`
- `timeout`
- `output_budget`
- `concurrency_cap`
- `checkpoint`
- `partial_result`
